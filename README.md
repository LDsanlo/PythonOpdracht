Welcome to Cost Manager!

In the life of a student, it often happens that you spend more than anticipated or expected. While your parents provide a weekly allowance for survival in student accommodation, additional costs can arise from events and parties. Consequently, after a few months, you may suddenly find a significant dent in your checking account. Manage your expenses with Cost manager!

Note: This package calculates your balance regardless of whether it is positive, it is credit card user friendly.

This package has been developed to keep track of all your financial transactions and extract various statistics, including:

- How much did I spend last week?
- Am I spending more than I am earning?
... (see the help command)
